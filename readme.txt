## CRAWLWP SEO: WordPress SEO & Indexing Tool

*Boost and monitor your WordPress site's visibility on Google, Bing, Yandex, Naver, Yep, and Seznam.cz with automatic indexing and SEO insights.*

CrawlWP is a WordPress SEO plugin for faster search engine indexing and comprehensive SEO insights, ensuring your WordPress content gets indexed instantly across major search engines (Google, Microsoft Bing, Yandex, Naver, Yep, Seznam.cz) and tracking your SEO performance in real-time.

[Website](https://crawlwp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) | [Documentation](https://crawlwp.com/docs/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) | [Support](https://crawlwp.com/support/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion)

CrawlWP instantly notifies search engines whenever your website content is created, updated, or deleted, ensuring that search engines always have the latest updates about your WordPress site.

### How CrawlWP SEO Indexing Works ###

CrawlWP integrates with IndexNow protocol to submit your WordPress posts and content to Microsoft Bing, Naver, Seznam.cz, Yandex, Yep.

Because Google does not support the IndexNow protocol, CrawlWP integrates with Google Indexing API to directly submit WordPress posts for indexing.

It also integrates with Bing URL Submission and Yandex APIs for submitting WordPress content for indexing. You might not need to configure and use the direct Bing and Yandex API integration for indexing since they both already support the IndexNow protocol.

= ðŸ¤– What is IndexNow? =

IndexNow is a protocol that allows website owners to promptly notify search engines about content changes, such as new, updated, or deleted URLs. It is a collaborative effort among several search engines (Bing, Naver, Seznam.cz, Yandex, Yep), enabling them to share received URLs with one another.

### Core Features ###

* **Instant Indexing**: Automatically submit your WordPress content to Google, Bing, and Yandex for immediate indexing after publication.
* **Indexing on Content Change**: Request indexing from Google, Bing, Yandex, and other search engines when contents (post, page, custom post types) are updated in WordPress.
* **Multi-Search Engine Support**: Compatible with Google Search Console, Bing Webmaster Tools, and Yandex Webmaster.
* **Automated Submissions**: New WordPress content is automatically submitted for indexing.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How quickly will my content be indexed? =

While CrawlWP submits your content instantly, the actual indexing time depends on each search engine. However, using CrawlWP significantly speeds up the discovery and indexing process.

= Is using the Google Indexing API recommended? =

Google recommends explicitly using the Indexing API for job posting and live streaming websites; however, it can be utilized for any website.

Please note that submitting content via IndexNow protocol or using the Bing and Yandex API in CrawlWP is entirely safe and recommended.

= I submitted a URL but didn't see the URL indexed. =

Waiting for your pages to get indexed can be anxious, but CrawlWP helps speed up this process. Based on our experience, pages usually get indexed within 24 hours of submission, often within a few hours. However, search engines (Google, Microsoft Bing, Yandex, etc) ultimately control the exact timing.

= Why do I not see all the URLs submitted indexed by search engines? =

Search engines can choose not to crawl and index URLs if they do not meet their selection criteria.

= Can I submit the same URL many times a day? =

Avoid submitting the same URL many times a day.

= Can I submit new redirects? =

Yes, you can submit URLs newly redirecting (for example, 301 redirect, 302 redirect, HTML with meta refresh tag, etc.) to notify search engines that the content has changed.

= I received an HTTP 429 Too Many Requests response from one Search Engine. What should I do? =

Such HTTP 429 Too Many Requests response status code indicates you are sending too many requests in a given time. Slow down or retry later.

= I have a sitemap. Do I need CrawlWP Indexing? =

Sitemaps help webmasters inform search engines about their WordPress pages, but search engines don't visit them often. With CrawlWP integration with IndexNow and the Indexing API of search engines, you can directly notify search engines of new content without waiting for them to crawl your sitemaps.
